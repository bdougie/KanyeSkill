  "He sold his first beat to local Chicago rapper Gravity for $8,800",
  "Kanye attended Chicago State University/Columbia College in Chicago. He dropped out to pursue music which is why he named his 2004 debut album, The College Dropout.",
  "Unbelievably, Rock-A-Fella were initially reluctant to sign West, with Jay Z revealing down the line that they were unsure due to West's formidable reputation and work as a producer.",
  "West's late mother Donda-a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University and later Chicago State University-retired from teaching to become her son's manager for the early part of his career.",
  "He got his first big break through No I.D. (born Dion Ernest Wilson) is a veteran hip hop producer and current VP at Def Jam. He taught Kanye how to produce beats and gave him his start in the music business-all because their moms forced the two to hang out.",
  "No I.D.'s mother convinced him to meet this  energetic  kid, and the lessons paid off:  At first it was just like, 'Alright man take this, learn this, go, git git git.' But eventually he started getting good and then I started managing him. West's subsequent success only bolstered No I.D.'s reputation outside of Chicago-a powerful lesson in why you should probably listen to your mother.",
  "He initially rose to fame as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records. He is was influential on Jay-Z's 2001 album, 'The Blueprint', producing 5 of the 13 tracks and two bonus tracks, more than any of the other producers on the album.",

  "West was the most nominated artist at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards with 10 nods, and he took home three trophies - Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song for Jesus Walks and Best R&B Song for producing Alicia Keys' You Don't Know My Name.",
  "Following the success of his The College Dropout album, he treated himself by purchasing an 18th century aquarium with about 30 koi fish in it.",
  "With the headline Hip-Hop's Class Act, West becomes one of the rare entertainers to appear on the cover of Time. The lengthy article details the contradictions of The College Dropout and of West himself, who admits that when starting out in hip-hop, It was a strike against me that I didn't wear baggy jeans and jerseys and that I never hustled, never sold drugs.",
  "He used the money from the Diamonds from Sierra Leone music video to raise awareness about blood diamonds and the abuse of human rights that happen in the mining process.",
  "He caused controversy when he strayed from his scripted monologue at the live televised Concert for Hurricane Relief when he said George Bush doesn't care about black people. With a shocked looking Mike Myers at his side, West's comments air live on NBC on the East Coast but are edited out of the West Coast version later that night.

  "He launched an online travel company called Kanye Travel Ventures (KTV) through his official website in 2008.",
  "After the infamous Taylor Swift Gate VMAs incident in 2009, he decided to leave the country for a while. He went to Japan, then Rome, before finally moving to Hawaii for 6 months to start working on music again.",
  "In addition to avoiding the VMAs backlash, 'Ye was able to slow down and spend time reflecting. It was the first time I got to stop, since my mom had passed, because I never stopped and never tried to even soak in what all had happened, he later told Ellen Degeneres. Plus he got to do fun stuff like intern at Fendi.",
  "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind director visited the studio on the same the day West was recording Diamonds From Sierra Leone, producer Jon Brion told MTVÂ .

  "Kanye and Royce have a long-standing feud stemming from a 2003 song that West produced for the Detroit rhymer titled Heartbeat.

He has since stated that he will never work with Royce again.",

  "Kanye opened up a burger chain in Chicago called Fatburger in 2008. When he opened it, he said he had plans to open 10 stores. He opened two before running into some financial problems and so he closed them down in 2011.",
